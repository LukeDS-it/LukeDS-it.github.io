## Cookie policy

Cookies and other: I make use of Google Analytics to make statistics about the usage of my website. If you agree to cookies,
you let me know the general area where you come from, your language, age range. I'm going to forget I have Analytics after
a couple weeks that I have launched this website, so you'll definitely be sure I don't share this information with anybody.

## Tech info

This website was created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I made the theme myself and should work on all modern devices.

Soon to come: to update the Jekyll pages, I'm building a microservice-based system called webfleet. You can find more information
here: [webfleet](/software/webfleet)
