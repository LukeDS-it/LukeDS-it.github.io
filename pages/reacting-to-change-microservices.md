             As time goes by, the user base of an application grows, and so does the application
             itself. To avoid that the heavy workloads and the growing codebase submerge us, and
             be reactive to changes and requests, the microservice architecture, if properly
             applied, can greatly help to keep the pace of evolution.

# REACTing to change with microservices

<div class="note">
    Please note: I am writing this page as personal notes while learning more about the microservice
    architecture. By writing this I aim to summarise and order concepts so that I will improve the
    learning process, hopefully this byproduct will be useful for other people as well.
