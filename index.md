# Hi, I'm Luca!

Dear reader, welcome to my website.

My name is Luca, I'm an Italian developer whose interests widely space in many fields.

At first I started programming for fun, whilst doing my classical studies, at age 15.
It was then that I realized that the thing I liked most was dealing with computers
and telling them what they have to do.
During my free time I always experimented with technology and, eventually,
my favorite hobby became my job.

But I don't always stick in front of a computer: I also enjoy a wide range of other activities,
such as mountain biking, taking photos, playing music, cosplaying.
This is why in these pages you'll find more than just software-oriented stuff,
so you'll get an almost-360Â° overview on myself.

Thanks for coming here, and enjoy your read!
