    My photography teacher said that we have to keep only a handful of pictures for
    each trip or photo shoot we do. This encourages us choosing the best shots only
    and having pictures that we will actually look at in the future, because if you
    have tens of thousands of them, you'll never browse them once in your lifetime.

A passion of mine since I was younger was photography. During my life I had all kinds of
cameras, from toy cameras, to throwaway cameras, to the first electronic ones, then my
first digital...

And then as smartphones came into our life I suddenly stopped having an interest for cameras,
thinking that the phone was good enough to do what I needed.

But inside me, something always lurked, and then I was gifted a DSLR at my graduation.

This reignited my interest in photography, and here I will share some galleries of what I think
are my best shots.
